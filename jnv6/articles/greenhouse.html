					<h3>Project Summary</h3>
					<p>Project "Greenhouse" is a digital monitoring system for greenhouse environments. Metrics, such as temperature, pHlevel and water level, are captured by sensors and transmitted to an online storage system. The real-time metrics can be accessed through computers and mobile devices to help farmers monitor remotely, saving time and resources for the business. This project is still in early development.</p>

					<h3>My Role:</h3>
					<h5>Lead UX Researcher</h5>
					<p>As the lead UX researcher, my job was to steer the direction of an idea to a marketable service. I worked closely with the product designer and stakeholders to define our business objectives. Communicating with greenhouse farmers, I was able to create a list of user requirements to fulfill their needs.</p>

			Project Goals:
	* Create a product that integrates "smart-home" concepts for an agricultural purpose
	* Develop a software service and hardware package
	* Produce an MVP to demo to potential clients

What problem does this solve?
	Having access to real-time metrics allows business leaders to make informed decisions about how to allocate labor and resources. Offering monthly services (maintenance, data analysis) will allow us to gain revenue after the purchase and implementation of our product.

Why is this project worth doing?
	New agricultural markets are increasing, especially in the organic foods sector. Most farmers do not have access to real-time metrics (water level, pH level, light level) and have to check manually and infrequently. Our product looks to improve the information needed to make business decisions and lower the labor spent monitoring crops.

Is this better than the alternative?
	At the moment, our competitors are markets to large scale operations, but do not have the robust business model to support small-to-medium sized agricultural opertions.

Methodology: Discovering the User

	Understanding the user was one of the more challenging aspects of this project. When the project was first designed, it was a product that offered a service, but did not have an ideal userbase in mind.

	Through user interviews with several greenhouse growing operations across multiple states, we we discovered that our initial design was not a good fit for our targeted audience. Our product was complex and powerful, but our demographic didn't have the same grasp of software and statistics to allow an informed business decision.

	<Questionaire artifact>

	Field studies uncovered that our users spent more time trying to distinguish problematic plants and diagnosing what went wrong. The user would have to spend time testing the pH level, checking the water level, examining for mold or bugs, and finding a solution.

	Personas and user profiles were built based on our meetings with greenhouse employees at all levels. We found that there were three primary archtypes of users that would be using our product. Our next challenge was to sit down and evaluate each of the user's requirements and how they evolve with usage of our product.

	<Persona profile artifact>

	After several visits to various greenhouses, our team went back to the drawing board to take what we learned and apply changes to make our software more valuable.

Reinventing the Wheel

	Our first meeting after our visits at the greenhouses generated a list of product requirements, both for our project team and what features our potential clients need.

	Our list of product features needed to be refined, and a large number of features are to be released in future versions of the product. We narrowed down the number of release features from 7 down to 3.

	<Business requirement stuff>

	Once we had our new list of business requirements, our team went back to our potential clients and performed a survey detailing what parts of the business could be improved. With those new suggestions in mind, we went back to our feature list and revised.

	Each research iteration helped us understand our user's needs better, and provided the insight on what exactly we needed to build. Of course there are ambitious features we'd like to add, but we now understand that we go to the users first.

What our competitors do right

	Discovering the business model for our competitors gave us the opportunity to think about how to generate profit off of our product after selling a tangible object. Our lead competitor sells itemized modules for each sensor, along with services to access the sensor data.

	Our initial plan was to sell our sensor package accompanied with our full software service at a fixed price. After understanding how a subscription model would be more profitable, our team decided to look into what solutions we could offer on a monthly basis.

Designing the UI

	Our most recent stage is making all of the transmitted data available on a mobile device screen. I started by brainstorming with the team and asking a series of questions:

		Where are the user's going to use this? In an office setting or inside the greenhouse?
		How should we organize the displayed information? By category? By plant location?

	<UI Brainstorm artifact>

The Next Steps

	Since our team has been able to take a strategic approach to discovering our user's needs, we have been having a much easier time bringing our idea to a tangible product. We have changed our process of how we evaluate new features.
