          <h2 class="text-center">Rewarding millennials to invest in Non Profits via microdonations</h2>
					<p>Groundswell gives users a prepaid debit card that takes the institutional fee and gives back to the NPO. The challenge is to create an experience without having the full functionality of a banking application.</p>

						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>In a world where millennials are the emerging market demographic, non-profit organizations must find novel ways to raise funds to sustain their mission. The GroundSwell Card program allows non-profit organizations to appeal to donors with and without disposable income, crowd-sourcing microdonations that otherwise would have been absorbed by bank fees.</p>
						<p>GroundSwell is a client that had to take a unique pivot to save the fidelity of their product. Through clever analysis of altruistic behaviors, we were able to create an engaging experience that turns a banking application into a do-good feel-good application.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>The Challenge</h3>
						<p>A requirement to be a finanical application is access to real-time banking data (via API endpoints). After the initial design, our team was informed that we would not have real-time access to metrics, and would only be given a data dump one every 24 hours.</p>
						<p>The new challenge was to redesign a finanical application that taps into altruism and uses gamification rewards to encourage behavior.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>My Role: UX Designer</h3>
						<p>My role as a UX Designer was to create an experience of delight for a user, and move away from the traditional banking experience. I worked in defining the "delightful" experience, along with the creation of requirements and wireframes. My role required me to interact directly with clients and manage an offshore development team.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Create a financial app without the robust functionality of a financial app</li>
							<li>Design a delightful experience to encourage users to make a difference</li>
							<li>Utilize offshore resources to develop a responsive web application</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What problem does this solve?</h3>
						<p>By moving the focus of a financial application to a community focused experience, we will fulfill the requirements of limited functionality and give delight to users by showing that they are making a difference.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Why is this project worth doing?</h3>
						<p>Giving back to society is a noble cause. Enabling people to make an altruistic contributions without having to change behavior gives a feeling of satisfaction knowing that they are making a difference.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Is this better than the alternative?</h3>
						<p>There are tons of financial applications out there, and the idea of diverting institutional fees from prepaid debit cards isn't a new feature. The competitive advantage is taking those institutional fees and giving back to Non Profit Orgs. This satisfies a painless, altruistic need to make a difference in the world while not changing any pre-existing behavior.</p>

					<h3>Change in Requirements</h3>

					<p>The largest obstacle to overcome was the lack of support from the payment vendor - meaning GroundSwell would have restricted access to the financial information of the user. That creates a problem of a banking application doesn’t have access to any financial information.</p>

					<p>With that change in requirement, our team explored opportunities to double-down on the purpose of the application - allowing users to make micro donations to support the non-profit of their choice.</p>

					<p>The team went into a discovery session to understand who the user is and what motives they might have for using the application. Whiteboarding ideals, motives, and hesitations gave us a clear direction, to create a community experience where users would be invested into their own avatar.</p>

				<h3>Defining Delight</h3>

				<p>With the centerpiece of this project moving away from financial information and creating a delightful experience. Our idea is to have a gamified element which changes based on activity with the application.</p>

				<p>The next step was to involve the stakeholders to define the vision. Our team presented a variety of styles and animations, and together we defined “delight” in the context of GroundSwell.</p>

				<div class="iframe-container">
					<iframe 
					src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRsRciS9dVRP28uoXrElDyUVxE0qdd6wO1cIwXUTk-db0eFcrDWtSzeBkQwSJ9XtoU3lsMwgL2nBZAa/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000" 
					frameborder="0" 
					width="960" 
					height="569" 
					allowfullscreen="true" 
					mozallowfullscreen="true" 
					webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
				</div>

				<p>The purpose of this presentation was to change the vision of the stakeholders and to let the imagination wander.</p>

				<p>From this presentation, we were able to make a decision on how to approach delight and what theme to use going forward. The concept is a flourishing garden which invites visitors, who appear based on spending performance. This reinforces positive behavior and helps GroundSwell work towards their business objectives.</p>

				<h3>Logic and Animation</h3>
				<p>After exploring the concept of delight, our team needed to focus our efforts on a tangible product. Our solution is the creation of a landscape that grows and attracts visitors through positive reinforcement.</p>

				<h3>Wireframe and Visual Design</h3>
				<p>Realigning from a banking application into something more personal also means that the original design must be revised. The amount of information relating towards banking is deliberately reduced.</p>
				<p>The focus of the new design gives more emphasis towards the delight and community reach of the application, while including simplified financial metrics.</p>
