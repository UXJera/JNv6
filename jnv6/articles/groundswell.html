          <h2 class="text-center">Rewarding millennials to invest in Non Profits via microdonations</h2>
					<p>Groundswell gives users a prepaid debit card that takes the institutional fee and gives back to the NPO. The challenge is to create an experience without having the full functionality of a banking application.</p>

						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>In a world where millennials are the emerging market demographic, non-profit organizations must find novel ways to raise funds to sustain their mission. The GroundSwell Card program allows non-profit organizations to appeal to donors with and without disposable income, crowd-sourcing microdonations that otherwise would have been absorbed by bank fees.</p>
						<p>GroundSwell is a client that had to take a unique pivot to save the fidelity of their product. Through clever analysis of altruistic behaviors, we were able to create an engaging experience that turns a banking application into a do-good feel-good application.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>The Challenge</h3>
						<p>A requirement to be a finanical application is access to real-time banking data (via API endpoints). After the initial design, our team was informed that we would not have real-time access to metrics, and would only be given a data dump one every 24 hours.</p>
						<p>The new challenge was to redesign a finanical application that taps into altruism and uses gamification rewards to encourage behavior.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>My Role: UX Designer</h3>
						<p>My role as a UX Designer was to create an experience of delight for a user, and move away from the traditional banking experience. I worked in defining the "delightful" experience, along with the creation of requirements and wireframes. My role required me to interact directly with clients and manage an offshore development team.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Create a financial app without the robust functionality of a financial app</li>
							<li>Design a delightful experience to encourage users to make a difference</li>
							<li>Utilize offshore resources to develop a responsive web application</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What problem does this solve?</h3>
						<p>By moving the focus of a financial application to a community focused experience, we will fulfill the requirements of limited functionality and give delight to users by showing that they are making a difference.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Why is this project worth doing?</h3>
						<p>Giving back to society is a noble cause. Enabling people to make an altruistic contributions without having to change behavior gives a feeling of satisfaction knowing that they are making a difference.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Is this better than the alternative?</h3>
						<p>There are tons of financial applications out there, and the idea of diverting institutional fees from prepaid debit cards isn't a new feature. The competitive advantage is taking those institutional fees and giving back to Non Profit Orgs. This satisfies a painless, altruistic need to make a difference in the world while not changing any pre-existing behavior.</p>

					<h3>Discovering the User</h3>
					<p>When the project was first designed, it was a product that offered a service, but did not have an ideal user base in mind.</p>
					<p>User interviews with several agriculturalists running greenhouse operations in multiple states, we discovered that our initial design was not a good fit for our targeted audience. Our product was complex and powerful, but our demographic didn't have the same grasp of software and statistics to allow an informed business decision. Our users wanted something they could look at briefly and inform what action needs to be taken.</p>

					</div>

					<p>Personas and user profiles were built based on our meetings with greenhouse employees at all levels. We found three primary archetypes of users that would be using our product: the Boss, the Analyst, and the Worker.</p>

						<h5>Greenhouse Personas</h5>

					</div>

					<p>Field studies uncovered that users spent more time trying to distinguish problematic plants and diagnosing what went wrong. The user would have to spend time testing the pH level, checking the water level, examining for mold or bugs, and taking time to correct the issues.</p>

					<p>After visiting several greenhouses, our team went back to the drawing board to take what we learned and apply changes to make our software more valuable.</p>

				<h3>Reinventing the Product</h3>
				<p>After our visits at the greenhouses, our team needed to generate a revised list of product requirements, both for our project team and what features our potential clients need.</p>
				<p>Our list of product features needed to be refined; a large number of initial release requirements, such as statistical analysis, were moved to a future release. Our list narrowed from 9 release requirements to 4.</p>

				<div class="element-container">
					<h5>Requirements and Specifications</h5>
					<div class="element-text">
						<h6>Business Requirements:</h6>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Affordable prototype and MVP</li>
							<li>Ability to scale with features</li>
							<li>Sellable product to our intended market</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Release Features:</h6>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Real-time data monitoring</li>
							<li>Push alerts to warn of data that falls out of range</li>
							<li>Out-of-the-box functionality (no assembly required)</li>
							<li>Mobile and Desktop accessibility</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Future Features:</h6>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Statistical analysis for own ecosystem</li>
							<li>Statistical analysis for cross-ecosystems for all clients</li>
							<li>Consultation feature for strategy and future planning</li>
							<li>Automation for adjusting light levels, pH, so-on</li>
							<li>AI pattern analysis for suggested optimal growing actions</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<figcaption>Above are a simplified requirements and features list for the Greenhouse project.</figcaption>
				</div>
				<p>Once we had our new list of business requirements, our team went back to our potential clients and performed a survey confirming which requirements are most valuable to them - an affordable and easy-to-use product that provides real-time measurement.</p>

				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>Understanding the business model of our competitors gave us the opportunity to improve our own business model. Our lead competitor sells itemized modules for each sensor, along with services to access the sensor data.</p>
				<p>Our initial plan was to sell our sensor package accompanied with our full software service for a one-time cost. Project Greenhouse learned from the competitors that the subscription model of data analytics as a service should be leveraged.</p>

				<!-- <h3>Designing the UI</h3>
				<p>Our most recent stage is making all of the transmitted data available on a mobile device screen. I started by brainstorming with the team and asking a series of questions:</p>
				<ul class="ul-list">
					<li>Where are the user's going to use this? In an office setting or inside the greenhouse?</li>
					<li>What key features are needed upon MVP release?</li>
					<li>What is the best way to go about visually representing the data?</li>
					<li>How should we organize the displayed information? By category? By plant location?</li>
					<li>Which metrics are going to be the most important? How do we allow users to traverse between metrics?</li>
					<li>How much information is TOO MUCH information? When will the application become too taxed and break?</li>
				</ul>

					<figcaption>The image above shows some of the UI considerations for the Greenhouse App. Link to a larger canvas showing more design considerations.</figcaption>
				</div> -->

					<h3>The Next Steps</h3>
					<p>Since our team has been able to take a strategic approach to discovering our user's needs, we had an easier time bringing our idea to a tangible product. We have changed our process of how we evaluate new features in order to get a product completed in a reasonable time.</p>
					<p>My research gave a succinct problem statement to the designers and product owner, which makes it easier to create a good solution. The team is focused on reaching the goal of an MVP, and less concerned about including all of the desired features that were wanted upon initial release.</p>
