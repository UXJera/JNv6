          <h2 class="text-center">Simplifying the HR process for Stanford University</h2>
					<p>Stanford University partnered with RampGroup to find a better improve the human resource operations by creating essential tools to simplify the process.</p>

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Stanford University is one of the most prestigious universities in North America. With over 10,000 employees on payroll, the Human Resource department is expected to operate quickly and without problem. </p>
						<p>Yet not everything works out seamlessly. Sometimes paperwork gets lost, people forget minute details, and information gets entered incorrectly..</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>The Challenge</h3>
						<p>Stanford University had many problems dealing with antiquated system. Finding correct filing information can be difficult to find and comprehend. Mistakes in reporting are common, which leads to a backlog of support requests for correction. Communication outside of the system is necessary to complete an HR operation. Many users are frustrated with the existing system, and the learning process for new HR employees is strenuous.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>My Role: UX Designer</h3>
						<p>As a UX Researcher, it was my duty to gather requirements and validate design decisions through usability testing. As a UX Designer, it was my duty to design two platforms to accommodate the needs of our two primary user types.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
						<ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Reduce the number of errors in the HR process</li>
							<li>Streamline communication process for HR transactions</li>
							<li>Create a useful and delightful experience for two primary user types</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What problem does this solve?</h3>
						<p>Our solution is the creation of a new system that combines elements of a legacy system, to simplify the HR transaction process for Stanford. The system is composed of two parts: A simplified Manager Portal and a detailed Human Resource interface.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Why is this project worth doing?</h3>
						<p>Redesigning the existing system will reduce the time and resources spent on HR transactions, and lower the frequency of communication-based mistakes.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Is this better than the alternative?</h3>
						<p>The only alternative is the existing system, as there are no out-of-the-box solutions to this problem. The only true solution is the creation of a new system that is tailored to the needs of the Stanford Human Resource Department.</p>

					<h3>The Story of James Smith</h3>
					<p>James Smith was a former employee of Stanford. He worked in finance and was quite good at his job. One day, he received a strange email that told him that due to his poor performance, he was no longer going to be employed at Stanford.</p>
					<p>James went to his manager demanding answers. The manager was just as confused but told him not to worry about it. James returned to work as if nothing had happened.</p>
					<p>In the following weeks, James noticed that he did not get a paycheck for the last period. Upset, he went to his manager looking for answers. The manager assured him that he was a valued employee and that she would get to the bottom of this issue.</p>
					<p>The manager went in person to the Human Resource department to see why James was fired. The HR representative asked for the name of the employee: James Smith. After entering that into the search field, the HR representative said there were 4 different James Smiths in the system.</p>
					<p>And then it became painfully clear: someone had selected the wrong James Smith. A hard-working individual was let go (and eventually moved on from Stanford), and someone who was meant to be terminated was kept on the payroll.</p>
					<p>How could this happen? The largest problem was that there was no clear intake process for starting a HR transaction. Emails, phone calls and the occasional in-person visit were all the pieces of information provided to the HR department. Sometimes, the information is entered incorrectly; as is the case with James Smith.</p>

					<h3>Understanding the Process</h3>
					<p>The existing process to conduct a HR transaction involves a large number sequence of communication channels. A supervisor meets with a manager to propose a change to an employee, the manager meets with the HR representative from that school, who then reaches out to the dedicated Stanford HR department and makes a request. This chain of communication is stitched together with phone calls, hand-written notes, emails with document attachments, and in-person conversations; the number of disconnects that could result in an error are enormous!</p>

					<p>Working with the HR department at Stanford, we were able to create a simplified process which moves the entire process online. Having a dedicated process which tracks all of the interaction pieces and compiles them into a system.</p>

				<h3>Two Personas - Manager and HRA</h3>
				<p>There are two types of users that we are designing for, and rather than making a single system that would not satisfy the needs of both user types, we decided to separate the functionality into two distinct modules.</p>

				<!-- <p>[[ Personas // User Types ]]</p> -->


				<p>The first persona type is the Manager, who is a person who works closely with supervisors and direct employees. This person deals with the day-to-day operations of managing a team, and has many responsibilities outside of the human resource aspect of the position.</p>

				<!-- <p>[[ Personas // User Types ]]</p> -->

				<p>The second persona type is the Human Resource Administrator, whose responsibility is to take the information from the manager and enter it into the system that outputs to PeopleSoft. This user type is extremely detail-oriented and must have all of the information at their fingertips to make the right decision. </p>

				<h3>Wireframes: Streamlining Information and Reducing Error Rate</h3>
				<p>After defining the personas and user flows, it was time to build an interface for our two personas.</p>

				<p>The wireframes for the managers would be a dashboard which would allow them to start basic transactions, such as offering a 1-time bonus or changing the hourly rate of an employee. Our approach is to create an intuitive experience that seeks to reduce the burden of conducting a HR transaction. We want to give customization and personalization. Since managers come from a variety of disciplines and skill levels, each users’ needs will differ, so being able to allow personalization makes the tool adaptable and favorable to the user.</p>

				<!-- <p> [[ Wireframes for Manager Center ]]</p> -->

				<p>The next wireframes are for the HRA, which is a power user persona with loads of data interpretation. Our approach for this user type is to hierarchically organize the most important information at the top, while having drill-down ability to look at the verbose details. This looks to include all the information from a single page, while using progressive disclosure of tabs and modals to lower the amount of information seen on the page at one time.</p>

				<!-- <p> [[ Wireframes for HRA ]]</p>
 -->
				<p>After creating the wireframes and applying some minor visual design, we sought to validate our assumptions that the new system would streamline information, reduce error rate, and have a look & feel treatment satisfactory to our target users.</p>

				<h3>Usability and Validation</h3>
				<p>The next step was to conduct a usability study to confirm our assumptions. I was chosen to fly out to Stanford and perform 30-minute usability testing sessions for 15 participants over 2 days.</p>

				<p>This usability study was testing the participant’s ability to logically process the workflow (change pay rate and hours) and gather feedback for advanced preferences.</p>

				<div class="element-container">
					<h5>InVision Prototype</h5>
					<a href="https://invis.io/WMQJNLBJ4GR" target="_blank">

					</a>
					<figcaption>Landing page to the Invision Prototype for Stanford Manager Center</figcaption>
				</div>

				<p>The results of the usability study were reassuring. All 15 participants were able to complete the workflow without any errors. The secondary task was to gather qualitative feedback and soundbites from participants.</p>

				<p>Most of the critical feedback came to the personalization for each manager; the prototype that was developed didn’t have interactive modules and was designed for the workflow. The responsibilities of each manager varied, where some managers only need to validate timecards, while others want to know the status of their department’s budget. We learned that these secondary modules (already existing in the current manager center system) need to be flexible enough to allow managers to make the decision of what information they need.</p>

				<h3>Overall Impact</h3>

				<p>With the completion of our design, Stanford started development for both Manager Center and the HR portal. This is the 4th transaction module that we have completed with Stanford since starting work in 2017. Both programs are currently in User Acceptance Testing and are expected to begin alpha testing in mid-June.</p>

				<p>The positive reception and success of this application will leverage another round of funding to complete more modules and additional workflows. We anticipate an additional 3 transaction modules will be awarded to RampGroup once the next round of funding is approved from Stanford.</p>

				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>Working with Stanford has been a delightful experience. The problem statement for Stanford was simple, but designing a solution was a challenge due to heavy technical requirements. The amount of domain knowledge needed to fully understand the problem was immense.</p>
				<p>The stakeholders for the project were incredibly kind and understanding, which made it easy to collaborate and design with. Both teams showed a tremendous amounts of patience and produced high quality work.</p>
