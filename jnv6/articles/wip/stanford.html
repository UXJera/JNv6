						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>Stanford University is one of the most prestigious universities in North America. With over 10,000 employees on payroll, the Human Resource department is expected to operate quickly and without problem. </p>
						<p>Yet not everything works out seamlessly. Sometimes paperwork gets lost, people forget minute details, and information gets misfiled.</p>
						<p>Stanford University partnered with Ramp Group to find a better improve the human resource department by creating essential tools to simplify the process.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>The Challenge</h3>
						<p>Stanford University had many problems dealing with antiquated software systems. Information can be difficult to find and comprehend. Mistakes in reporting are common, which leads to a backlog of support requests to correct the mistakes. Communication outside of the system is necessary to complete an HR operation. Many are frustrated with the existing system, and the learning process for new HR employees is strenuous.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>My Role: UX Designer</h3>
						<!-- <p>My role as a UX Designer was to create an experience of delight for a user, and move away from the traditional banking experience. I worked in defining the "delightful" experience, along with the creation of requirements and wireframes. My role required me to interact directly with clients and manage an offshore development team.</p> -->
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
						<!-- <ul class="ul-list">
							<li>Create a financial app without the robust functionality of a financial app</li>
							<li>Design a delightful experience to encourage users to make a difference</li>
							<li>Utilize offshore resources to develop a responsive web application</li>
						</ul> -->
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What problem does this solve?</h3>
						<p>Our solution is the creation of a new system that combines elements of a legacy system, to simplify the HR transaction process for Stanford. The system is composed of two parts: A simplified Manager Portal and a detailed Human Resource interface.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Why is this project worth doing?</h3>
						<!-- <p>Giving back to society is a noble cause. Enabling people to make an altruistic contributions without having to change behavior gives a feeling of satisfaction knowing that they are making a difference.</p> -->
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Is this better than the alternative?</h3>
						<!-- <p>There are tons of financial applications out there, and the idea of diverting institutional fees from prepaid debit cards isn't a new feature. The competitive advantage is taking those institutional fees and giving back to Non Profit Orgs. This satisfies a painless, altruistic need to make a difference in the world while not changing any pre-existing behavior.</p> -->

					<h3>Understanding the Process</h3>
					<p>The existing process involves a large number sequence of communication channels. A supervisor meets with a manager to propose a change to an employee, the manager meets with the HR representative from that school, who then reaches out to the dedicated Stanford HR department and makes a request. This chain of communication is stitched together with phone calls, hand-written notes, emails with document attachments, and in-person conversations; the number of disconnects that could result in an error are enormous!</p>

					<p>Working with the HR department at Stanford, we were able to create a simplified process which moves the entire process online. Having a dedicated process which tracks all of the interaction pieces and compiles them into a system.</p>

				<h3>Two Personas - Manager and HRA</h3>
				<p>There are two types of users that we are designing for, and rather than making a single system that would not satisfy the needs of both user types, we decided to separate the functionality into two distinct modules.</p>

				<p>The first persona type is the Manager, who is a person who works closely with supervisors and direct employees. This person deals with the day-to-day operations of managing a team, and has many responsibilities outside of the human resource aspect of the position.</p>
