						<h4>Project Objective</h4>
						<p>SupportCarryZilean.com is a resource guide for League of Legends players who are eager to learn more about playing Zilean in the support role.</p>
						<p>There are many guides covering all aspects of play and suggestions on how to be the best team player.</p>
						<h4>New Skills Used</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Flexbox</li>
							<li>AngularJS for static and dynamic content</li>
							<li>FileZilla</li>
							<li>More organized file structure</li>
							<li>Atom</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Insights Learned</h4>
						<p>This was my first time building a full website without a framework or grid system, so the experimenting with Flexbox was incredibly fun. One key insight that I learned from Flexbox is that prefixing is a neccesary part of any project, especially if you do not plan on using a framework.</p>
						<p>Along with compatibility, I learned that iOS and Safari had a rough time with the website until things were able to be sorted out. I also made the decision that I would not try to program the website for IE, as the user base which I was targeting is of a higher tech proficiency than most users.</p>

						<h4>Project Objective</h4>
						<p>This website shows the work that I have been a part of, as well as the progress that I have made as a UX Designer.</p>
						<p>This is the 6th iteration of this website, designed towards a the popular single-page websites, along with several quality content pages describing my work.</p>
						<h4>New Skills Used</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>GitHub</li>
							<li>Foundation 5</li>
							<li>Grunt/Gulp</li>
							<li>JQueryUI</li>
							<li>Mobile First Approach</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Insights Learned</h4>
						<p>When I orginally started building this website, I thought it wouldn't take long. Yet as I started working on it, I became more aware of little things that I would like to do differently.</p>
						<p>Although I've known about the mobile first approach to writing CSS, I've always coded for the screen size in front of me, then scaled back with media queries. This time, I started the design process thinking about mobile first, then the transition into larger screen sizes.</p>
						<p>Additionally, I've also revisted the content strategy of each page and aligned those articles to be more UX focused, rather than the original intention of the articles.</p>

						<h4>Project Objective</h4>
						<p>This is a listing website for the furniture that my family was looking to sell before we moved to Washington. Unfortunately, it is out-dated since we have already moved and sold many of the items on the website.</p>
						<h4>New Skills Used</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>AngularJS for populating content</li>
							<li>More JS than normal</li>
							<li>Command line functions</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Insights Learned</h4>
						<p>This was a quick website that I build for my family. I took the time to try out using AngularJS for the recursive items, instead of having to list every single item.</p>
						<p>I will admit that I don't fully understand AngularJS, but I do see the power that the framework holds. There were many useful ways for me to quickly alter data to reflect changes in product and prices.</p>
						<p>That said, there are a few design decisions that I would go back and do differently, such as putting a main-wrapper over the whole page to shrink content on larger screens closer to the center, rather than spreading content to the edges of larger screens.</p>

						<h4>New Skills Used</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Bootstrap 3</li>
							<li>JQuery</li>
							<li>Sass</li>
							<li>Compass</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Insights Learned</h4>
						<p>This iteration of my portfolio is a polishing of the previous version, with content and styling cleaned up. Before, there was too much white space and the page looked incredibly flat. I sought to change that by incorporating pattern backgrounds and darker contrasts.</p>
						<p>This project was also the first where I started working with Sass/Scss and compass, where I had a single .scss stylesheet with everything piled into it, including Bootstrap's css.</p>
						<p>I also learned about Bootstrap as a grid system, which relieved many headaches in the design and coding of this website. At the time, I fell in love with Bootstrap.</p>
