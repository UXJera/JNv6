My passion is understanding how people think and why they behave as they do.

I began my journey into Psychology back in 2010, where I started learning behavioral psychology at Wichita State University.

Over the next couple of years, I interned at a Human Factors lab, learning how people interact with technology and how behavior is shaped by that.

After graduating college in 2012, I knew that my journey into User Experience wasn't complete, and the next path was to learn more about websites and mobile applications.

Here we are now in 2016, and below are samples of the user experience related work I have been a part of.
