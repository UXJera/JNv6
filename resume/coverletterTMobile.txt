Hello and thank you for the opportunity!

My name is Jeremiah and I am a freelance UX research and designer who has recently moved to Bellevue, Washington. I was referred to the position of Web Producer by a friend of the family, although I did not find out if it was an employee referral or from a social network.

There are two parts to this job that I would like to share my work experiences with to show that I am a great fit for the position: Content Creation and UX Design.

I have been a Digital Content Producer for the past 3 years. I have worked at a television station in Wichita, KS for close to a year creating web stories for local and national news. Before that, I was a Content Director for a League of Legends website where I had to create my own articles, as well as manage 8 other writers. The platform that I have the most experience with is WordPress, although I do know HTML and web design. I know how to write formally and I know how to write to the casual audience (more favored by younger audiences).

The second part of the job is the Web Design and having experience with... User Experience. I graduated college with a degree in Psychology and interned in a human factors lab for almost 2 years. I've learned many user experience strategies from this, and have implemented them into many of my future projects. After college, I started learning how to build websites and the best UX practices and how the web has evolved over the past 5 years. While I do have coding knowledge, I much prefer to work within the psychology domain and help find the best possible experiences that a user can have.

Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to hear back from you soon!

Cordially, 
- Jeremiah Nyman
